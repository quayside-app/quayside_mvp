Welcome to our Quayside MVP. The tech stack for this is the MERN framework (Mongo DB, Express.js, React Next.js, and Node.js). This will be hosted on Google Cloud Services.

## Setup
You need to install npm (you can do this by installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)). Once that is done, run `npm install` in this directory to install all the requirements.

For accessing the mongo database locally, you will need the following Atlas creds in an `.env.local` file:

```
MONGO_USERNAME=<your username>
MONGO_PASSWORD=<your password>
```

## Usage

First, run `npm run dev' to start the development server.


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

If you add any other dependencies, please do it by running `npm install --save <my-dependency>` so it is added to package.json for the next person to install. Otherwise, add the package manually to package.json
